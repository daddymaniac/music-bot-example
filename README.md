## Getting stared with Glitch

1.  Create your bot account at **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers)**, get the token, and invite him to your server
2.  Go to **[glitch.com](https://glitch.com)**, click **New Project**, then choose **`Clone from Git Repo`** button (we recommend you to make a Glitch account before doing this)
3.  Fill the pop-up column with **`https://github.com/zhycorp/music-bot-example.git`** at the field, then click **`OK`**
4.  Rename the **`.env_example`** to **`.env`** instead, then specify the prefix for your bot, fill the bot's token too. Don't forget with the **`PROJECT_DOMAIN`**'s value, match this value with the name of your Glitch bot project
5.  Change the project's name to whatever you want (optional)
6.  And your Discord music bot should be ready to use!

_If you have made any changes to the code, don't forget to restart the bot by typing **`refresh`** at the **`Tools > Console`** button._
